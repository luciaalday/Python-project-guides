    "1. Two players begin with 7 cards in their hand.\n",
    "2. The goal of the game is to have the most pairs of numbers when the draw pile runs out.\n",
    "3. Each turn, one player asks the other if they have one of their cards. For example, a player with a seven may ask, \"Do you have a seven?\". If the other player has the card, they are obligated to hand it over and the player who asked gets to discard the two cards and increase their number of matches by one.\n",
    "4. If a player runs out of cards before the draw pile runs out, they may pick up 4 more, or the remainder of the draw pile if it is less then 4 cards."
